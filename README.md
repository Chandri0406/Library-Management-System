# Library Management System Project

## Overview
This project evaluates your understanding and application of Core Java, OOP, GUIs, and CRUD operations on a database. It involves creating a desktop application using NetBeans GUI Builder with Swing and performing CRUD operations on a JavaDB. Additionally, a web application using Apache Tomcat or GlassFish with a PostgreSQL database will be developed.

## Objectives
1. **Web Application**: Implement a login and registration system using JSP/Servlets and PostgreSQL.
2. **Desktop Application**: Develop a Library Management System using Java Swing for managing books, authors, borrowers, and loans with CRUD operations on a JavaDB.

## Milestones
### Milestone 1: Web Application - Registration and Login System
- **JSP Pages**: `index.jsp`, `register.jsp`, `login.jsp`, `welcome.jsp`
- **Servlets**: `RegisterServlet`, `LoginServlet`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with `Login` and `Registration` tables

### Milestone 2: Desktop Application - Library Management System
- **GUI**: Developed using NetBeans GUI Builder
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage books, authors, and borrowers in JavaDB
- **OOP Principles**: Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction

## Requirements
- **Core Java and OOP Concepts**: Collections, exception handling, OOP principles
- **GUI Development with Swing**: User-friendly interface with proper layout management
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, view, update, and delete records for books and borrowers

## Setup Instructions
1. **Web Application**: Deploy on Apache Tomcat server.
2. **Desktop Application**: Use NetBeans for GUI development and JavaDB for database operations.
